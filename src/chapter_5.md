# Chapter 5


This is my favorite part.

We've finished our library code and we've done the busywork to get input from the user via command line arguments. The only thing left to do is glue it all together.

I put my code for ths step in a module called `commands` because it's designed around the four subcommands that we support. You can structure your code however you want here.


## Assignment
Map your command line arguments to your PNG code and bring this project home!
