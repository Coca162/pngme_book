# Goals

1. Provide an assignment
   1. Create a CLI app that works with secret messages hidden in PNG files
      1. Encode a message
      2. Decode a message
      3. Remove a message
      4. Print a list of chunks that can be searched for messages
2. Provide unit tests that verify the required features
   1. Give type names for anything that has to be unit tested
   2. Provide additional unit tests commented out that serve as hints for how to accomplish the assignment
3. Provide links to useful resources applicable to each chapter
   1. Try to offer at least two links for each thing in case one of them stops being valid in the future
   2. Links shared between chapters should be provided in each chapter
      1. The goal is for the reader to use resources
      2. I want them to focus on writing code and keeping momentum
   3. Suggested search phrases should also be provided 
4. Provide some small amount of discussion before the unit tests
   1. Not sure what this will be like yet but I'll have a better idea once the unit tests are written
5. Do not provide the completed code
   1. This is an intermediate tutorial
   2. If you read the book and you have some experience writing code, you can do this yourself
   3. I'll send my code to anyone who sends me their code
6. Minimize friction
   1. It should be easy to find the information you need. Let reading the info be the challenge
   2. Unit tests should be plentiful enough that they serve as real useful hints
7. Add unit tests for different languages
   1. This would be fun for other people to do
   2. It's basically an easy open source contribution
   3. Maybe Takumi will do Kotlin
   4. This is also a good learning opportunity
   5. Provide a list of required tests
   6. They can add any extra they want
   7. They can decide which unit tests start commented out
      1. Or I can do that if they don't care
